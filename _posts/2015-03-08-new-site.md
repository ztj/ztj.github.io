For a while now I have been meaning to take more direct control of my website. I've never
been entirely satisfied with using services like [Tumblr][] or [postach.io][] for hosting my site
despite the conveniences that they offer. I was especially enamored with [postach.io][] due 
to the unique way it loaded content from [Evernote][]. However, in the end, the limitations
of all of these systems got to me.

So now I'm hosting my site, which hardly has a purpose anyway, on [GitHub][] pages. This
essentially allows me to put whatever content up I want without being restricted by the 
built in rendering support and media support of the site, to a certain degree. It's much
more like old school static file hosting, which is fine for me. On top of the static
hosting, [GitHub][] offers support for the [Jekyll][] site engine, which amounts to a parser to
generate a baked website.

I'm not sure that any more useful or interesting content will appear here, but, at least
I know I can stick up a random experimental HTML file or something when I feel like it.

Oh, and it's *free*.
