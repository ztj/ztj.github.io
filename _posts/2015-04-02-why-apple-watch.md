title: 'Why I Will Wear the Apple Watch'
--- 
When I learned of the Apple Watch I had not really given any thought to such a
device. I only knew what existed did not have the capability
to deeply integrate with my technology platforms of choice. So I took a
while after the announcement to realize why it would be desirable to me.

The fact is, before anyone explained this—as has recently been done on
the [Wired article about Kevin Lynch](http://www.wired.com/2015/04/the-apple-watch/), 
Dye, and Ive's goals for the
device—I realized that it would represent exactly the things I do with
my phone that made me hate the idea of phones growing larger. Even
iPhone 6, not 6 plus, seems far too large to me _for a phone_. This is partly because I'm
a semi-minimalist. I don't want to carry more than needed with me. It's
a burden. However, the bigger issue is the size itself causing more and
more difficulty getting my phone in and out of my pockets, especially
while sitting; causing more difficulty interacting quickly with one hand
or in situations where my grip might be compromised. It hit me in
January that the watch would represent all of these quick, short, low
investment interactions that made a large device frustrating. In
anticipation of this usage, I actually traded my iPhone 6 up for an
iPhone 6 Plus. I sold my iPad. My intent was to merge my uses of these
devices and adopt the Apple Watch into the set. iPhone 6 Plus is no
longer a _phone_ to me. It is truly my pocket computer, the true center
of my digital universe.

To see even more emphasis on my perception of the purpose of the watch
directly communicated to Wired and others makes me feel especially
confident that I will be a very happy Apple Watch owner. My #1 use for
the watch is just what is advertised: getting all my notifications and
glance-like information directly from my wrist, just as I have found the
time of day for most of my life. I can check the weather for the next few hours
as well as my schedule to see if I can fit in a bike ride and it will
take all of a glance at my wrist, maybe a swipe or two. And if in that
moment I suddenly need to address some other matter (like, say, it's my
turn at the grocery queue earlier than anticipated) I don't have to
do *anything* to recover full use of my hands. I'll have absolutely zero concern
about properly replacing my giant phone in my pocket and not dropping
it. I can simply forget about what I was doing and continue on with what
matters.

Sure, it seems like nothing until you realize that a highly connected person such
as myself, such as most of you reading this, will pull out their phone
over 150 times per day. That is not a made up number. That is based on a
[study](http://elitedaily.com/news/world/study-people-check-cell-phones-minutes-150-times-day/) by 
Nokia that is already over 2 years old. The number is probably
higher now and probably *much* higher for people who are more connected
than average. Think about it: 150 times per day, maybe 200? Two hundred
chances to accidentally toss your phone across the room; o accidentally
miss your pocket and drop it on the floor; to accidentally smear that
sauce that was on your finger but you didn't know it was on your finger
all over your screen and in the cracks around your home button. (We can
rinse off our Apple Watch and not violate the warranty while the same
can not be said about the phones.)

Now 200 times is a lot, but the interactions we're talking about are
usually short. However, there is a far bigger chance you'll be sucked
into a distraction of little importance if you "already have the phone
out, may as well dig in." In doing very little, the watch will do a lot.
It will help us mentally filter and prioritize incoming information and,
without even blocking notifications (which I suggest you consider doing,
really consider what notifications actually matter to you,) you will
probably respond to fewer. I know I will. I know my own nature.

So you're potentially saving an enormous amount of time, not just 200 ×
3 seconds per day. You're potentially saving 50 swipes through Facebook or
Twitter that did not need to happen at all. You are potentially stopping
100 separate pull-to-reloads of your Inbox because that is what you do
when you unlock your phone: mindless, manual checks for the latest
updates. Instead, just relax and trust the watch to inform you of what
matters. I mean, definitely configure your notifications such that this
is possible, but, still, no more polling, guys, seriously. Just stop.

So that's my #1 biggest hope for the watch, that it will fulfill that
expectation. After that, I have a number of smaller expectations. For
example, in my crappy old car with an aftermarket stereo that supports
bluetooth, it's often very hard to navigate to the content I want to
hear without retrieving my phone. But, the only reason I ever even use
bluetooth for audio—and accept that massive drop in quality—is so I
don't need to get the phone out. If I get it out, I'm going to dock it
and plug it in and have full audio quality and UI. But that takes time,
a series of tedious actions, and another mental burden. With the watch,
I should be able to kick off my music, and hopefully even podcasts and
the like depending on how well the relevant apps support the watch. At the very
least, I can pick a playlist when, for whatever reason, the phone's audio playback
state is so lost that I can't even trigger a shuffle all without arguing
with Siri.

Another thing I look forward to, controversial as it may be, is
recording my thoughts in the shower. Yes, I will shower with my $1,100
Space Black Stainless Steel watch and take that risk. No, I don't expect
to do much with the watch there, but, activating Siri and asking it to
take a note should be doable and that's all I need or want. Well, that
and the time. I am notoriously bad at taking short showers.

I am actually a pretty regular user of Siri for a certain narrow set of
use cases mainly revolving around reminding myself of things later. I
add to reminders lists, some for shopping and some for actual tasks that
are pulled into OmniFocus automatically. I'll be able to do that even more
conveniently now. When it comes to successfully implementing task
management, every tiny bit of overhead or barrier to your system that
you can remove, the more likely you are to use it and reap the benefits.
Even just 1 second less effort increases that chance I'll actually make
a reminder for something. And hey, I won't have to carry the phone
around at home anymore. I have WiFi. I won't need pockets. I can laze
about in my knickers and still have full on Siri reminder-taking
goodness. "Hey siri, add pants to my buy list..."

I'll be writing an app for the watch as well. It won't be original. It
probably won't even be the best, but, it will be fun. It will be a
childhood dream, in a way, to be writing software for a computer on my
damned arm. But more importantly, it will scratch an itch of mine. It
will actually be useful. It will be dead simple. But, on any other
device, it would be too simple to justify its existence and my effort.
Better to just use a notepad type app that's more general than spend
that much time for such a narrow use case. But, not now. Now it will be
perfect.

I certainly plan to make use of notifications, a tap on the wrist, in a
contextual manner. I expect to use just about every aspect of the watch
except the fitness sensors only because they don't really fit into my
life. I cycle regularly, about 2 hours per week during this season at
high levels of effort. I use a cycling computer (Garmin Edge 810) that's
far better than any phone, watch, or band at what it does and have no
intention of replacing this. It pairs with a dedicated wrist-band HR
monitor and sensors on the bike and all that data is streamed together
and eventually poured into [Strava](http://strava.com). I don't use Strava's 
iPhone app for ride tracking purposes anymore either. 
However, all this data eventually makes its way into
Apple Health. So, assuming that is the One True Source of info about
your health and activity throughout the day, I'll still benefit from the
activity monitoring features to some degree. I'll also benefit from the
standing reminders, as science in recent times has shown very certainly
that sitting too long is a huge burden on your health and I'm a Software
Engineer... I sit way too long. I don't care about step tracking, as
conversely, science has shown no real benefit to merely walking about.
Sorry guys. But even small amounts of vigorous exercise has huge
benefits, and when I'm not cycling, I do have some backup exercises that
the watch can be used to track.

I will use the watch to remotely control my Apple TV and my Hue lights.
I'll take notes in Evernote. I'll tick off tasks in OmniFocus. I will
probably interact with notifications/glances from a number of other
apps. I'll be lied to frequently by Dark Skies! (Just kidding, it's
correct like... 70% of the time and I live in a challenging location for
what it is trying to do.) And since this area of technology will finally get real attention thanks
to the Apple effect, I expect a number of other uses, hopefully all very
short interactions, that I will get from this device over the coming
years.

I keep seeing people downplay the life changing nature of this device. I am
sorry you have such a boring tedious life that can not even be remotely
impacted by such a pervasive set of capabilities, but, if even 1/5th of
what I've listed works out as I expect, my life will be noticeably
improved. It will be objectively changed. "Life-changing" does not
require your entire life be redefined to be true. It can be as simple as
never forgetting a shower thought, ever again.
