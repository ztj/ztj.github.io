title: 'MacBook: Day One'
--- 
Recently, Apple announced—and then released—a new laptop referred to simply 
as "[MacBook](http://www.apple.com/macbook/)." Its headline features revolve
around classic Apple design pushing with extreme size constraints, and a lot
of invention. The laptop is extremely thin, light, and clean in terms of design.

The laptop also sports an incredibly low power system design. The highest available
CPU clock speed is a "mere" 1.3GHz. The RAM is 8GB in all configurations. And,
there is no fan at all. Perhaps the most controversion design element is the lack
of ports. It has one USB-C port and one headphone/microphone combo jack. The USB-C
port is primarily there for powering the device. No, more specifically, it is there
for *charging* the device. As a bonus, it can double for every other connection
one may find necessary. But, the point here is that many, if not most, laptop users
today do not really need ports on their device. Wireless is the way of the future
and this laptop exemplifies this. 

Of course, people who actually write reviews of technology products are probably
the very worst people to make these observations. Tech writers have anything
but a typical user profile and so their commentary is almost universaly worthless.

So, where do I stand on this device? Well, for the past couple of years, I have
toted around an iPad Mini or iPad Air to act as a kind of portable personal space
in the computing world. I have a MacBook Pro 15" w/Retina that is maxed out in
terms of specs and provided to me by my employer. I don't require a laptop of my
own. However, I, like most people, tend to do personal things while at work. I
prefer not to do too much personal stuff on work property. You never know what
kind of data mixups may happen and it's generally good to keep a clear separation
between those worlds. So I carried my iPad along with a keyboard case to sort
of provide a portable personal space. It worked pretty well, but, I began to hit
the limitations of the iPad when I started to take personal interest in more
programming topics that weren't relevant to work.

I truly believe that, with the right software support, the iPad could be a great
tool for software developers. However, producing that kind of tooling takes
an immense amount of time and effort. I do not have that time and do not have the
will to put out the effort. So I found myself looking for hacks, like SSH into
my personal desktop at home for full access to compilers and file systems and
all the other aspects of software development tinkering. But, it was never 
a very good user experience. I loved the portability of the iPad Air 2, and its
sheer power within its confines. But, I needed a laptop to have access to my
personal space and software development tinkering at the same time on the go.

Luckily, at almost exactly the moment I was accepting this reality, Apple made
their announcement of the new MacBook. While others may have been looking at
this device and thinking about how underpowered it must be and how strange it
is to have merely one port that is also used for power, even going so far as
to pan it as just a laptop version of iPad—as though that was a bad thing—I was 
salivating. This was exactly what I wanted! If the iPad was reborn as a Mac
laptop, that would be perfect.

The MacBook was perfect for me.

Now, that dreaming and idealism that comes with the announcement of a new 
product that seems like it truly is what you want is often muted by the
calculations of whether that device can actually do what you need or want
it to do. The big question: was the performance of this ultra low power
device going to suffice? Will it simply be too weak to work as a programmer's
tinker toy?

So that brings us to day one. Yesterday I took delivery of my lovely new MacBook,
in Space Grey, and maxed out with what little choices one has for specs on
this device. To recap, that means we have 8GB RAM, 512GB Flash Storage, and
a 1.3GHz Intel Core M Dual Core processor. That seems incredibly weak compared
to either my personal iMac (32GB RAM, 512GB SSD, 3.5GHz Core i7) or my MacBook Pro,
which is similarly overpowered. It isn't unreasonable to be somewhat concerned
that the lower power machine may not provide a satisfying working environment
for a programmer.

It took a few hours to get the basic system set up to my liking. At some point I 
had the thought that, perhaps, I should simply not use my usual tool set. No IDE,
for example. I thought it would save me the frustration of waiting for the slower
CPU to deal with all the multitudes of operations an IDE performs. However,
I realized it was silly not to try.

In my day to day work, Java is my primary tool. So, as all long term Java programmers
eventually learn, the IDE of choice is IntelliJ IDEA. I installed it, and set
my expectations very low. I took my time working through the configuration to find
any and all options that I felt could improve the performance in this restricted
environment. There wasn't much. I did find a few key items such as increasing 
delays for auto completion and eliminating passive autocompletion pop-ups. I 
have often been annoyed by these behaviors anyway. Another option that gives a huge
boost in perceived performane is disabling animation of windows.

I loaded up my most recent project from work. It's a Spring Boot proof of concept
web application. It ran. It worked. And it wasn't even painful to work with. Sure,
it definitely started more slowly than I am used to from my MacBook Pro. There
was no surprise there. However, what did surprise me is that the responsiveness of
the IDE was maintained at more than an acceptable level. And while I realize that
this is very early in the process of discovery, I am quite hopeful for the future
prospects of software development on this device.

The entire time I'm trying these things out, I completely forgot that I had a 
whole host of software running in the background. We're talking both Safari and
Chrome, Reeder, iMessage, Telegram, Evernote, OmniFocus, Mail with multiple accounts,
 Dash, and utilities like Bartender. Oh, and Time Machine was completing the first 
backup of the machine, a mere 93GB wirelessly. In short, the machine was working
for me.

In conclusion, I am very impressed. I have never had a lower powered laptop that
could perform so much so admirably and still be so light, small, totally silent and
basically the most beautifully designed laptop ever. I hope that this level of
experience is maintained over time. But, regardless, I already know that I can use
this machine when traveling to maintain an ability to do real work anywhere I go.

And most importantly, this device will serve me very well for its intended use
as a personal space for my daily browsing breaks, video, music, etc. as well as
being a wonderful programming playground when I need a distraction from the
rather predictable daily grind.

Oh, one last thing to mention: the battery held up wonderfully during this entire 
experiment. I did everything on battery. I worked on setting up my environment and
tested out compilation and debugging and everything else entirely off the wire. I
easily spent at least 3 hours doing this and had an estimated remaining battery
life of 4.5 hours. I actually think that was a notable underestimate and also 
reflects the activity of backing up the machine and all the initial copying and so
on that goes on when setting up a working environment for the first time.

TL;DR: MacBook performs far better than one would expect based on its stats. I
can work in IntelliJ IDEA perfectly fine. Battery life is great. Highly recommended.
