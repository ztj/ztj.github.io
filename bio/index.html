<p>Who I am is what I do, and perhaps to a lesser degree what I say.</p>
<p>Less abstractly, I am a man living in the United States of America.</p>
<h2>What I Do</h2>
<p>I am autodidactic to the extent it might be considered
	a philosophy or faith. I taught myself nearly everything I know
	that is important to what I do professionally and what I pursue
	personally.</p>
<p>I am also a scientifically inclined father and husband who enjoys
	the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur">amateur</a> 
	pursuit of photography from time to time. I am
	enthusiastic about music, art, and literature, but, not to the 
	extent that you are likely to see me say much about it here. I find
	such topics are better saved for more personal venues.</p>
<p>I have been known to obsess over technology, design, and, most recently, wine.</p>
<p>Professionally, I make software. I make computers do things that are—hopefully—useful
	and interesting. For over 10 years I have worked in the education industry. I
	mainly work behind the scenes with software that enables learning
	institutions in various ways. Most recently, I am involved in projects
	with goals to enhance ongoing assessment of student performance. Essentially,
	the projects I work on aim to help teachers—and the students themselves—become
	more aware of what their strengths and weaknesses are on an ongoing basis. These tools may
	also be used to provide suggested courses of action for further study and, when necessary, remedial effect.</p>
<h2>How I May Be Contacted</h2>
