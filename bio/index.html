<p>I am a citizen of the United States of America.</p>
<p>I am autodidactic to the extent it might be considered
	a philosophy or faith. I taught myself nearly everything I know
	that is important to what I do professionally and what I pursue
	personally.</p>
<p>Whenever I can find the time, I am a cyclist for both body and mind.</p>
<p>I have been known to obsess over technology, design, and the ever-nebulous concept of user experience.</p>
<p>Professionally, I make software. Some of the areas in which I have been focused
	include message oriented middleware (think pubsub, or something like Kafka, except I built it from the ground up before Kafka existed,) vertical and horizontal integration 
	of disparate data systems, learner efficacy and mastery analysis, larger scale
	data analysis for reporting, usage prediction and machine learning applications.
